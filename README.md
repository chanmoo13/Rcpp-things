# Rcpp-things

This Repository is about studying how to use Rcpp in Statistical Computing.

The R and C++ codes in the "Listings of Dirk Eddelbuettel" folder are basically following the book "Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp" of Dirk Eddelbuettel.

The R and C++ codes in the "Examples" folders, are a few example function source codes which are thought to be easy or useful when I use Rcpp with statistical computing.

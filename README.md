# Rcpp-things

This Repository is about studying how to use Rcpp in Statistical Computing.

Basically it is following the book "Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp" of Dirk Eddelbuettel.

In an "Examples" folders, there are a few example function source codes of C++ and R which are thought to be easy or useful when I use Rcpp with statistical computing.
